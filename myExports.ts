export let myText: string = "Hello World";
// We create a variable named myText with the type of string and the value of "Hello World!"
//We put the export statement in fron so other ts files can use it.
// If you do NOT use the export keywork here the other files can NOT see what was exported.
// So always make sure that if you want other files to access it, that you clearly export it!
